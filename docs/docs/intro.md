# Intro

This pedal provides added control to the Line6 Helix Stomp and devices connected to it via USB.

Features Include:
- Recalling Snapshots
- Tuner On/Off
- Tap Tempo
- FS Control
- Sending MIDI Notes

With a few modifications this project could work with any device that supports MIDI.

The build was inspired by Stephen776's build [here](https://github.com/stephen776/stomptroller) and adds multiple pages, LED's and a Tap Tempo feature.
